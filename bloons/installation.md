# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Installing Minecraft plugins can be a tricky start, especially with a plugin with such a large codebase and lots of configurations like Bloons. This is your one-stop shop for a guide for creating a Minecraft server that support Bloons, adding Bloons, and ensuring the plugin works as expected.



## Technical Requirements

Bloons is a fairly lightweight plugin and doesn't use many resources server-wise, this means that it's light on memory,  CPU usage, and IO. Overall, Bloons doesn't use much IO as it keeps configurations like balloons and translations inside of its memory throughout the duration that the plugin is enabled.
