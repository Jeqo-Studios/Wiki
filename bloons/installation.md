# üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Installing Minecraft plugins can be a tricky start, especially with a plugin with such a large codebase and lots of configurations like Bloons. This is your one-stop shop for a guide to creating a Minecraft server that supports Bloons, adding Bloons, and ensuring the plugin works as expected.



## Technical Requirements

Bloons is a fairly lightweight plugin and doesn't use many resources server-wise, this means that it's light on memory,  CPU usage, and IO. Overall, Bloons doesn't use much IO as it keeps configurations like balloons and translations inside of its memory throughout the duration that the plugin is enabled.

### Recommended Server Requirements

As per the [paper documentation](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started), the server requirements are the following:

* Java Version: Java 21 (for Minecraft 1.20.x)
* RAM/Memory: 4GB-6GB Minimum
* CPU: Intel i5, Intel i7, xeon, or greater depending on the plugins the server is hosting
* Storage Space: 24GB or greater
* OS: Windows or a suitable Linux Distribution that can both install Java and run the official PaperMC server software or a PaperMC fork that contains the **Kyori Adventure Library**
* Network: 50MB/s or greater for download and 10MB/s or greater for upload

## Plugin Requirements

There are no plugin requirements for Bloons other than the base plugin itself at this point in time! You can go ahead and move forward throughout this guide.
